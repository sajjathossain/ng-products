## About the project

This project is a simple application that allows you to manage your products. It uses RxDB to store the data and Angular to render the UI. The UI is built using [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).
The application is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. It uses [@tanstack/table](https://tanstack.com/table) and [@tanstack/virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual) to render the data in a flexible and efficient way.
It also uses [ngx-sonner](https://github.com/tutkli/ngx-sonner) for notifications and alerts.
